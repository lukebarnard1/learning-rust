 * Heaps
 *
 * Heaps are stored in array such that the first element is the root of an incomplete binary tree.
 * The following two elements are the decendents (left, right) of the first node. The following
 * four elements are the decendents of the left and right node of the root, and so on.
 *
 *       1
 *     2   3
 *    4 5 6 7
 *   ...
 *
 * To traverse the tree, the following equations can be used on the current node index, i. Note the
 * tree is 1-indexed.
 *
 * Left node = 2i
 * Right node = 2i + 1
 * Parent node = i / 2
 *
 * Terminating nodes must also be represented. For simplicity, they will be represented with -1.
 *
 * Here's an example of a heap:
 *
 * [3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 4, 8, 1, 2]
 *
 * 0:         3
 * 1:      6     5
 * 3:    7   9  4  8
 * 7:  1  2
